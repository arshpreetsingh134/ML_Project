Anomaly Detection &amp; Movie Recommendation System using MATLAB  


In this project, we have implemented the anomaly detection algorithm and applied it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, we use Collaborative Filtering to build a recommender system for movies.   

To get the code running, you would need Octave/MATLAB software on your PC.
